#Assignment operators -
# = equal sign is how python  assigns operators
#a = 100. this lines means '100 is assigned to a'
# total = 1+1+1+1+1+2+3+4   -  The evelation has been assigned to total

#Arithmetic operators
# # Brodmas -  +,-,x,
# + - addition, \
# - - subtraction, \
# * - multiplication, \
# / - division, \
# e** - xponential (2 asterix show exponential)
# % -  Modulo operator  - (percentage sign. gives the remainder of values.
c = 10 % 2 # This function is used to check if its even or odd. check divisibility
print(c)
#find other arithmetic operators . eg. floor division.

#Comparision operators
#This one compares 2 values
# < -  less than operator
z = 10
y = 11
w = z < y
print(w)
#The result of comparision operators is true or false (boolean)
# > -  greater  than operagtor
w = z > y
print(w)

# >= -  Greater than or equal to
w = z >= y
print(w)

# <=  - less than or equal to
w = z <= y
print(w)

# == - This is called an equality operator
d = 1
e = 2
print(d==e) # One = means assignment, but 2 equals signs == checks if it is equals to.

# != - This is called and inequality operator . Basically... Not equal to
print(d!= e)

# comparion operators ate used to compare things and it is true or false.

# LOGICAL operators - Used to compare 2 scenarios
# and -  where you look for 2 condition or more. All conditions MUST be true
# eg. you get the following result, True and True and False  =  False

# or  -  AT LEAST ONE CONDITION is met (True) then you get a pass.
# true snd true  = true
#true and false  =  false
#false and false  =  false
#true or true  = true
#true or false =  true
#false or false  =  false

#not - It negates conditions

print(not(true and false))
# and is usually treated as a multiplication and or is treated as an addition hence and is processed first

print(not(1<3 and 2>4 or 3>3))
