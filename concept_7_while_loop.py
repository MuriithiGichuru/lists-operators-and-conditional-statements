#Concept 5 -  Iterations
#there are 2 types of loops. for loops and while loops
#print numbers from 1-10
# print(1)
# print(2)
# print(3)
# looping is to allow you to repeat things
#A WHILE LOOP - runs until a certain condition is false# a = 10
# a = a+1
# while a < 11:
#     print(a)
# a= 10

# a = 12
#
# while a < 11:
#     print('muriithi '*a)
#
#print even numbers
# a = 0
#
# # while a < 101:
# #     print(a)
# #     a = a + 2
# #Print odd numbers between 1 -100
# a = 1
# while a <=100:
#     print (a)
#     a = a + 2

# savedPin = '0000'
# trials = 3


# enteredPin = input('Enter your pin')
# trials = trials-1
# while savedPin != enteredPin and trials >0: #saved pin is not entered pin
#     enteredPin = input('Enter your pin')
#     trials = trials-1
# else:
#     if trials < 1 and enteredPin != savedPin:
#         print('Card blocked')
#     else:
#         print('Succesful login')
